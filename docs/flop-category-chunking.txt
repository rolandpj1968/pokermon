The flop is a huge path explosion in strategy/eval trees, since it's 3 new cards, and added to the hole cards this creates a lot of equivalence classes - ~8000 per hole card equivalence class.

It seems prudent to use an interim clumped/chunked representation of the flop, so that we get useful evaluation without full explosion of the tree.

Proposed categories. In general these categories will be augmented by straight/flush potential, hence there is a multiplicative effect.

Straight/Flush Potential:
=========================

Only when this includes a hole card.

1. Inner straight draw in 1.
2. Outer straight draw in 1.
3. Double inner straight draw in 2.
4. Inner/outer straight draw in 2.
5. Double outer straight draw in 2.

6. Flush draw in 1, high hole card
7. Flush draw in 1 (not high hole card)
8. Flush draw in 2, high hole card
9. Flush draw in 2 (not high hole card)

10. Flush
11. Straight

Complete flush/straight dominates draw in 1, and draw in 1 dominates draw in 2. Flush (draw) dominates straight (draw).

Pocket Pair:
============

1. Overpair
2. 2nd pair
3. 3rd pair
4. Underpair
5. Two pair, higher pocket pair
6. Two pair, lower pocket pair
7. Set
8. Full house
9. Quads

Cannot have complete straight/flush.

Mix straight/flush in only for categories 1 to 7. Categories 5, 6, 7 can only have straight/flush draw in 2.

Total categories: 4 * 9 + 3 * 5 + 2 == 53 categories.

Suited:
=======

1. Nothing
2. High card
3. High pair
4. Middle pair
5. Low pair
6. High 2-pair
7. Middle 2-pair
8. Low 2-pair
9. Set (with 1 hole card)
10. Full house
11. Quads

Completed flush/straight are their own category. 6, 7, 8, 9 can only have straight/flush draw-in-2. 10, 11 are own category.

Total categories: 2 (straight/flush) + 5 * 9 + 4 * 5 + 2 == 69 categories

Off-suit:
=========

Same as suited, except completed flush is not possible == 68 categories.
