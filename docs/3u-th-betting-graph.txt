3-up betting for fixed limit poker. Protagonists are B, SB and BB. Sadly upper and lower case don't hack it for 3 actors. Mmm, need italics etc. For now B actions are in <>

Node "" - pot BB + BB/2 - B acts

<F> - SB, BB live, pot BB + BB/2, rest of this is identical to heads-up
<C> - add BB, pot is BB*2 + BB/2, all 3 alive
<B> - add 2*BB, pot is BB*3 + BB/2
